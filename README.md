## Why Edge Computing is so important for AI
https://towardsdatascience.com/why-edge-computing-is-so-important-for-ai-e4695d4e7960

NVIDIA Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi 4 are two Single-Board Computers (SBC) whose features are extremely similar. 

While they are built with ARM processors, respectively with a Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 64-bit @ 1.5 GHz and a Quad-Core ARM Cortex-A57 64-bit @ 1.42 GHz, the biggest difference between these two boards is with the NVIDIA Jetson Nano including a higher performant, more capable GPU. 

The NVIDIA board includes a Maxwell microarchitecture with 128 CUDA cores @ 921 Mhz. 

CUDA (an acronym for Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel processing hardware architecture created by NVIDIA, on which software developers can write applications capable of performing parallel computing on the GPUs of NVIDIA video cards. 

This turns out to be a great advantage for Artificial Intelligence computation and mostly for making inferences.

### What to do (step by step) to upgrade ubuntu 16.04 to 18.04 on jetson tx2 ?
https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/what-to-do-step-by-step-to-upgrade-ubuntu-16-04-to-18-04-on-jetson-tx2/77668


To upgrade your TX2, you should reflash it with JetPack using the SDK Manager. 

The SDK Manager is designed to run on your PC (running Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64 or Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64), and it will connect to your Jetson board over Micro-USB and Ethernet. 

The SDK Manager that runs on your PC will then flash the latest software and Ubuntu 18.04 aarch64 OS to your Jetson.

### For more info, see the SDK Manager documentation here:
